News about ES releases
----------------------

Release 0.1.4  February 8, 2009
-------------------------------

NOTE: This release is tested with Fedora 9, Fedora 10, and Ubuntu 8.10.

This release improves the Web IDL support, containing updates for esidl,
esjs, the es kernel, and the 'setup' script.

  esidl
    * The type of a C++ function return value mapped from 'string' is 
      changed from 'int' to 'const char*'.
    * The 'I' prefix added to each C++ interface name has been removed.
    * The default base object interface name can be specified with the
      '-object' esidl command line option.
    * The interface ID is given by the fully qualified name of the interface
      rather than a DEC GUID. The use of DCE UUID based interface ID through
      '#pragma ID' has been deprecated.
    * The 'Constructor' extended attribute is now supported; esidl generates
      the following definitions inside the specified interface class
      definition in C++:
        * 'Constructor' interface class
        * createInstance() static class methods
        * getConstructor() and setConstructor() static class methods
  
  esjs
    * Update the 'new' operator to construct a new object instance whose 
      interface has constructor(s). The 'ClassFactory' interface has been 
      deprecated.
  
  es kernel
    * Support the Web IDL constructors and the qualified name based 
      interface IDs.
  
  binutils
    * Update to binutils 2.19.
  
  newlib
    * The "C" POSIX runtime implementation has been updated to use the
      qualified name based interface IDs.
      
  setup
    * Support Ubuntu (Tested with 8.10).
    * Install ES SDK under `pwd`/sdk, rather than under /opt/es, by default.
      
Examples

  Old esidl style:
    interface Process : Interface
    {
        #pragma ID Process = "DCE:3b6bc7bd-44c2-11dc-9c02-0009bf000001";
        // snip
    };

  New esidl style:
    [Constructor]
    interface Process
    {
        // snip
    };

  Old esjs style:
    classStore = ClassStore(root.lookup("class"));
    process = classStore.createInstance(CLSID_Process, IID_IProcess);

  New esjs style:
    process = new Process();

  Old C++ style:
    IMonitor* monitor = 
      reinterpret_cast<IMonitor*>(esCreateInstance(CLSID_Monitor, 
                                                   IMonitor::iid()));

  New C++ style:
    es::Monitor* monitor = es::Monitor::createInstance();


Release 0.1.3  October 25, 2008
-------------------------------

This release contains a number of contributions made by the students
participated in Google Summer of Code™ 2008. We've made the first step to
switch over to the new Web IDL standard for the system interface definitions.
The implementation of the TCP/IP stack has made some progress as well. This
release also contains the Web IDL based preliminary RPC runtime for x86 Linux
so that we can test and combine multiple ES software components running in
separate processes on Linux as a substitute for the ES kernel naively running
on PC.

CAUTION: We recommend to use Fedora 9 to build and test this release. Other
distributions and OS X will be tested and supported in the future releases.


Release 0.1.2  April 5, 2008
----------------------------

This is the first ES operating system release from Google Code. ES operating
system is now under the copyright of both Nintendo Co., Ltd. and Google Inc.
In this release, the license has been changed from "Historical Permission
Notice and Disclaimer" to "Apache License 2.0". Our appreciation goes to
people at Nintendo and Google who helped make this happen, and especially to
Genyo Takeda at Nintendo. We are also grateful to people at SourceForge.jp
for their support to our former project site in SourceForge.jp. Even though
ES is no longer a research project at Nintendo, the ongoing development of
ES will continue to make it useful for everyone in the future.

Technically, there are several bug fixes in this release so you can build ES
on x86 Linux operating system including Fedora and Ubuntu and on Mac OS X
Leopard with XCode, in addition to x64 Fedora on which ES has been developed
mainly so far. Another noticeable change is now esidl IDL compiler
automatically adds the "I" prefix to each interface class name in the
generated C++ header files; so you don't have to add the "I" prefixes to the
interface names in the IDL files and in ECMAScript source files. For a
complete list of changes, please see the ChangeLog file.


Release 0.1.1  December 10, 2007
--------------------------------

In this release, a text enhancement for the CanvasRenderingContext2D
interface has been added to the console service. Plus, by refining the
user-level mutex implementation, the performance of the ECMAScript
interpreter esjs and others has been improved.

Note: The patch files for newlib and fontconfig have been updated with
this release. Due to the change made to the definition of pthread_mutex_t,
please rebuild gcc and othere additional libraries before building the es
operating system.
