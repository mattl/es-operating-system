                              es 0.1.1

December 10, 2007

In this release, a text enhancement for the CanvasRenderingContext2D
interface has been added to the console service. Plus, by refining the
user-level mutex implementation, the performance of the ECMAScript
interpreter esjs and others has been improved.

Note: The patch files for newlib and fontconfig have been updated with
this release. Due to the change made to the definition of pthread_mutex_t,
please rebuild gcc and othere additional libraries before building the es
operating system.
