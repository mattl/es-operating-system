This directory contains ES operating system.

To build the ES operating system, a variety of development tools including
binutils, GCC, Newlib, and other runtime libraries need to be built. To
automatically set up the ES operating system software development kit, run
the 'setup' script out of the source directory, e.g.:

	cd
	mkdir es
	cd es
	wget http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/files/es-x.y.z.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf es-x.y.z.tar.gz
	es-x.y.z/setup

The 'setup' script will download the required files from the Internet, and
generate build tools, runtime libraries, and ES operating system disk image.
Note once the 'setup' script is started, it tries to install the prerequisites
like gcc, bison, etc., using 'yum' or 'apt-get' which requires you to execute
the 'sudo' command.

The 'setup.webkit' script will download the required file of webkit, and 
build webkit demo file for both Linux and ES operating system.
Note that you need to build ES operating system environment before invoke 
this script.

ES operating system is open source software. See the file LICENSE for 
copying permission. The manuals, and some of the software programs, are
under different terms; see the individual source files for details.
