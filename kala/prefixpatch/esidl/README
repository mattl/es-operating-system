This directory contains the esidl Web IDL compiler.

The esidl Web IDL compiler is an Web IDL compiler being developed for the ES
operating system; it can be used for products other than the ES operating
system. The directory named 'npapi' contains an example program that uses
esidl to create an NPAPI plugin efficiently. 

The following three steps should build the NPAPI plugin sample:

  CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g configure --prefix=[install directory]
  make
  make install

Note '-g' options are necessary at this moment. 

Then please copy libnpessample.so created in the install library directory
to ~/.mozilla/plugins, and open 'npapi/sample/sample.html' with the browser
(currently tested only with Firefox 3 on linux).

ES operating system is open source software. See the file LICENSE for 
copying permission. The manuals, and some of the software programs, are
under different terms; see the individual source files for details.

See http://code.google.com/p/es-operating-system/ for how to report problems.
